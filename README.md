# PDF to text
### Client side browser tool to extract text from a PDF file using PDF.js

Some cleanup will be performed on the extracted text including removing non-standard characters and extra spaces to provide a more readable output. You can download the extracted text to a (.txt) text file or copy it to your clipboard for further use. Your PDF file is processed locally on your device by your browser using <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/" target="_blank">Mozilla PDF.js</a>, and no data is transferred or stored elsewhere.
