# PDF to text

This pure HTML JavaScript tool allows you to extract text from a PDF file. It removes non-standard characters and extra spaces, providing a more readable text output. You can download the extracted text to a (.txt) text file or copy it to your clipboard for further use. Your PDF file is processed locally on your device by your browser using <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/" target="_blank">Mozilla PDF.js</a>, and no data is transferred or stored elsewhere.
